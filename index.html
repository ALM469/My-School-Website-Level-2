    <h1>What is a web site?</h1> <!-- This is a main heading--> 
    <p>A web site is a collection of web pages linked to a single name, such as google.com, 
        or learncoach.com. This name is called a Domain Name and you can get one for each of 
        your own web sites, usually for a small annual price.</p>

    <p>A web page is what you are viewing right now. A single digital media page designed 
        to be viewed in an app called a web browser.</p>
